### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**shipsnipe/Shipsnipe** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a retired marine/mechanical engineer managing ship maintenance & repair. I have used spreadsheets to manage
  several aspects of the projects that I have worked.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning navigation skills and using advanced skills of writing vba functions.  That means, I'm
  also learning about GitHub and how to use it to share some of my results.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- - âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy sailing, flyfishing, woodworking and other less extreme outdoor sports.
