### Hi there 👋

<!--
**shipsnipe/Shipsnipe** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m a retired marine/mechanical engineer managing ship maintenance & repair. I have used spreadsheets to manage
  several aspects of the projects that I have worked.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning navigation skills and using advanced skills of writing vba functions.  That means, I'm
  also learning about GitHub and how to use it to share some of my results.
- 📫 How to reach me: ...
- - ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy sailing, flyfishing, woodworking and other less extreme outdoor sports.
